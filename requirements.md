# POC Requirement – Task Management Application

## Overview

Design and develop a Full Stack Task Management Application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. The application should provide an intuitive user experience, a robust REST API backend, and persistent storage using a relational database.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Backend (Java Spring Boot)

Develop RESTful APIs to support the following operations:

* Create a new task
* Retrieve all tasks
* Retrieve task details by ID
* Update an existing task
* Delete a task
* Filter tasks by status and priority

### Frontend (Angular)

Develop a user-friendly interface that enables users to:

* View a list of tasks
* Create a new task
* Edit an existing task
* Delete a task with confirmation
* Mark tasks as completed
* Search and filter tasks

---

## Task Attributes

Each task should contain the following information:

| Field             | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Task ID           | Unique identifier               |
| Title             | Task title                      |
| Description       | Detailed task description       |
| Priority          | Low, Medium, High               |
| Status            | Pending, In Progress, Completed |
| Due Date          | Target completion date          |
| Created Date      | Record creation timestamp       |
| Last Updated Date | Record modification timestamp   |
